Row[2] = Mr. Daniels presented to the hospital with abdominal distention and fullness.  He was noted to have significant constipation. He felt better after having bowel movements following a bowel regimen.  He never had emesis.  He never had shortness of breath from the abdominal issues.  He is also noted to have ascites.  This was noticed during his last hospital stay.  At that time he underwent a paracentesis.  He was covered for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with peritoneal fluid demonstrating marked neutrophils.  I asked for repeat paracentesis to help with the fluid and also to reevaluate the white blood cells (i.e. confirm response to antibiotic).  Interventional radiology noted that they would wish to have brilinta held for 5 days.  Unfortunately, Mr. Daniels had a recent in-stent stenosis of a vein graft stent.  Coupling this with nice urinary output following diuresis (and evidence of decreasing edema on examination).  Paracentesis was not pursued.  I did review with the patient and his sons that if the patient fails diuresis he may indeed require repeat paracentesis.  Finally, Mr. Daniels was found to have urinary retention.  This was likely on the basis of the constipation however CT imaging also demonstrated enlargement of the prostate.  A Foley catheter was placed and he was also discharged on Flomax.  Despite his significant underlying medical conditions and advanced age Mr. Daniels was really doing very well.  He had no difficulty breathing and was tolerating his diet.  I did ask Mr. Daniels and his family members to return back to the hospital for abdominal discomfort and/or difficulty breathing or any new or worsening symptoms.  I believe this likelihood of his return is moderate to high in the near future.  His long-term prognosis appears poor as well..
