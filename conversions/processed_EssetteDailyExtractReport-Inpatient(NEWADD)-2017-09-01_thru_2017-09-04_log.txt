Patient was able to be weaned off the oxygen and now only requires oxygen at bedtime which she is on at home. Patient now stable for discharge. Patient's blood pressure medications were reduced to only amlodipine on discharge. Patient states she takes her blood pressure medications at home at night and she does not check her blood pressure. During hospital stay we noticed that patient's blood pressures were always on the lower side in morning.
