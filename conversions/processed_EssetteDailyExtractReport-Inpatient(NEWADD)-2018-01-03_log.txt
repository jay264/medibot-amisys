The patient had an unwitnessed fall yesterday and her daughter states that she has been complaining of some pain that seemed to be worse with movement. She was noted to have a rib fracture and sent home. She did have a CT of her head which showed no acute concerning findings. The patient's daughter states that she went down for a nap at about 12:30 and she seemed her normal self. Around 3 PM she awoke and was confused. She seems quite confused overall which is not normal for her. She does not wear oxygen at home. She has been complaining of a cough for the past couple days. She had not been complaining of any shortness of breath though the patient does tell me that she feels short of breath currently.
