Structures directly supporting the teeth mean the periodontium  which includes the gingivae  dentogingival junction  periodontal membrane  cementum  and alveolar process., The hospitalization or nonhospitalization of a patient has no direct bearing on the coverage or exclusion of a given dental procedure., When an excluded service is the primary procedure involved  it is not covered regardless of its complexity or difficulty. For example  the extraction of an impacted tooth is not covered. Similarly  an alveoplasty (the surgical improvement of the shape and condition of the alveolar process) and a frenectomy are excluded from coverage when either of these procedures is performed in connection with an excluded service  e.g.  the preparation of the mouth for dentures. In like manner  the removal of the torus palatinus (a bony protuberance of the hard palate) could be a covered service. However  with rare exception  this surgery is performed in connection with an excluded service  i.e.  the preparation of the mouth for dentures. Under such circumstances  reimbursement is not made for this purpose., The extraction of teeth to prepare the jaw for radiation treatments of neoplastic disease is also covered. This is an exception to the requirement that to be covered  a noncovered procedure or service performed by a dentist must be an incident to and an integral part of a covered procedure or service performed by the dentist. Ordinarily  the dentist extracts the patient’s teeth  but another physician  e.g.  a radiologist  administers the radiation treatments., Whether such services as the administration of anesthesia  diagnostic x-rays  and other related procedures, Continuation of Medicar Benefit Policy-Dental Exclusions from Coverage., , being performed by the dentist is covered. Thus  an x-ray taken in connection with the reduction of a fracture of the jaw or facial bone is covered. However  a single x-ray or x-ray survey taken in connection with the care or treatment of teeth or the periodontium is not covered., See auth A171110080 for Physician Review document., Letter is written in appropriate language with no abbreviations and is therefore approved., OSU restorative prosthadontist dept:, phone 614-292-1472  , ax 614-292-4960, Information received from Melissa Janes:, Previous approval for teeth extraction by in network doctor: Lindsey at Mt. Carmel Hospital is essentially null and void since this provider is unable to provide service in network., In place of that approval  we must approve this authorization. |  |  |  |  | 0 |
