Patient notably was discharged in the hospital about one week ago and. The patient describes that over the course the past week his pain has been getting gradually worse despite his outpatient pain medication. Patient has been on radiation treatment as well. Over the course the weekend the patient did start to develop severe diarrhea which has been present for the last few days. He has been taking some Imodium which the most part had not helped although today the diarrhea is somewhat improved.  Laboratory studies were obtained to triage which were remarkable for a leukopenia with white count of 3.1 as well as a hyponatremia that is new with a sodium of 125. The patient was started on IV hydration. Dilaudid was ordered for pain control.  , 02/15/17 CHANGED TO INPATIENT BY ATTENDING., 02/16/17 CRS Note - I discussed NGT decompression for another 24 hrs with patient and wife. His electrolytes are appropriate and he is not obstructed as evidenced by bowel function. I do not have a clear explaination for his abdominal distention.

As per discussion with son  the patient has been having recent decline in her mental status too.  She started having issues with her short term memory.  The patient's initial EKG was unremarkable except for frequent PVCs.  The patient started on tele to observe for any signs of cardiac arrhythmia that could have cause the syncope. The patient as well as her son denies any signs of seizure-like activity.  I suspect that her current episode of fall is precipitated by pain meds and benzos. As per discussion with her son  son is also concerned about taking too many pain medications. However also concerned about possible seizure disorder., CT of the head was unremarkable.   Would recommend to avoid sedative medications and the patient would benefit from home health care given her frequent falls., CLINICALS REVIEWED IN POWER CHART DO NOT SUPPORT INPATIENT ADMISSION STATUS.  WILL SEND PM CHANGE FORM TO CHANGE TO OBSERVATION | 02222017, 02232017, 02242017 | Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved,  | 3, 3, 3 |
