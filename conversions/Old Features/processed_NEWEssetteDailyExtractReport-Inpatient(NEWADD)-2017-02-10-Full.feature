She is a DNRCC and her daughter takes care of her at home as she requires full care. Initially her urinalysis was abnormal and there was not a clear source of infection therefore she was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin. The next day with the abnormal urinalysis the Zosyn was changed to Ceftriaxone since CXR was normal. Vancomycin IV was discontinued. Clostridium difficile toxin came back positive and she was started on Flagyl. Her urine culture was negative however completed 3 days of antibiotics for a UTI just in case. By the third day of admission her diarrhea has started to subside. Due to the patient's lethargy and increase in care  the patient will be discharged to SNF short term prior to discharge home with her daughter., CLINICALS REVIEWED IN POWER CHART DO NOT SUPPORT INPATIENT ADMISSION STATUS.  WILL FLIP AND SEND PM CHANGE FORM | 02062017, 02072017, 02082017, 02092017 | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 4, 4, 4, 4 |
