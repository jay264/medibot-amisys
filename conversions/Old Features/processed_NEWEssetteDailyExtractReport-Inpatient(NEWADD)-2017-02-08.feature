Patient is drowsy and not able to answer any questions. According to the husband and patient's blood sugars at home and been up and down all day  she took her Humalog in the evening without eating., DISCHARGE SUMMARY, 60-year-old white female who does have some mobility issues at baseline in which she walks with a walker  but was brought to the Emergency Department by her family with some altered mental status.  She has had episodes like this before.  She is on multiple medications that could affect her mental status  all of which we held initially including her baclofen  gabapentin and then also her Lasix and lisinopril were held for some mild acute kidney injury.  She was maintained in the hospital with supportive care  initially actually in the ICU for 1 night on BiPAP and she came around  did not need to be intubated and was sent out to telemetry the next day.  Neuro was consulted and does not believe it was related to recent seizure  although she has a remote history of a seizure disorder.  Her electrolytes were repleted.  She was given Kayexalate initially for some hyperkalemia  which is resolved and her ACE inhibitor and her Lasix were held due to her elevated creatinine.  I am ____ the floor for yesterday and today  she has been an awake and alert and pretty appropriate.  She tells me that she lives independently with her husband and a 16-year-old grandson.  She does walk with a walker due to neuropathy and she has a lot of chronic medical issues and is on a fair number of medications that she believes she is taking appropriately.  I had to call the Pharmacy where she fills her medications to make sure we had an accurate insulin orders.  She was a little hypoglycemic when the squad arrived  which could have contributed to her altered mental status and medically fragile patient at baseline., MEETS INPATIENT - NURSING JUDGEMENT - SLOW TO PROGRESS | 02032017, 02042017, 02052017, 02062017, 02072017 | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 |
