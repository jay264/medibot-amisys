X-rays of her L-spine, right hip and chest are all unremarkable. She has good range of motion of the right hip and is able to lift it off the bed without difficulty despite her pain so I have low suspicion for occult fracture. Head CT was obtained because she is on blood thinners and had a headache even though she was unsure if she hit her head or not. Head CT was negative. She presented nature fibrillation rapid ventricular response but after a single 10 mg bolus of diltiazem she converted to normal sinus rhythm. While she was in the emergency department she returned to be in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 120s and was put on diltiazem drip. She did have a small skin tear on her right elbow which was closed with Steri-Strips. She does have a significant urinary tract infection which was treated with doxycycline because the patient has multiple antibiotic allergies to all the first and second line recommendations for UTI. Urine was sent for culture. The patient has had 2 of these episodes her she's fallen the last 2 days. I am unsure if it is due to her atrial fibrillation or if she is experiencing orthostatic hypotension. Her vitals are not suggestive of sepsis. She was given antibiotics and urine cultures were obtained.", nil, nil]
