Reports episode starting at 11:30 PM that lasted about an hour. Had large volume output at that time which was maroon colored. No associated abdominal pain  nausea or vomiting., 98.2 79 14 93% 125/69, wbc 10.2 hbg 11.4 bun 22 cr 1.06, recent labs available for comparison drawn on 1/27/17. Hemoglobin was 12.4 at that time. He has had a drop of 1 g in the last week.  suspect this is a diverticular bleed once again. No evidence of ischemia or diverticulitis this patient is having no pain at all., GI consult= no further bleeding overnight. Last colonoscopy 10/16 w/ pandiverticulosis. Does report recent straining/constipation. Pt with low volume bleeding at this point.  At this point  would continue to monitor and hold off on endoscopic evaluations. Would encourage bowel regimen at home to prevent constipation., 2/04- no more GI bleed.  H&H stable. confused and delirious. GI  on board-- conservative management. Had one BM today. No further bleeding., 2/05- think  his delirium will improve if he goes to his known environment  at 94 yrs---  do not think it is rational to keep him in the hospital trying to treat delirium. Wife agrees with that- and comfortable for taking him home-- she has people around her home to help her if needed., *Clinicals reviewed do not support inpt status.

She was recently admitted with falls and found to have an acute L3 compression fracture in 1/2017. CT head noted a probable subacute/chronic infarct versus watershed infarct. MRI could not be obtained due to pacemaker.  After her January admission she was discharged to home with homecare and missed her Neurosurgery followup with Dr. Mallik. Imaging also showed a large right temporal lobe extraaxial hyperdense mass  most likely a meningioma. Dr. Mallik was consulted and ordered a CT head with contrast which showed a small right parietal infarct  moderate white matter disease  large meningioma overlying the right temporal lobe  unchanged. Per Dr. Mallik  the patient will need an elective myelogram and post myelogram CT of cervical and lumbar region once she is off Aspirin and Eliquis for 5-7 days. This will show if she is amenable to kyphoplasty and if she is having cervical radiculopathy. CTA of head/neck showed right cavernous carotid calcifications causing resultant reduced flow through the right MCA branches. Neurology was consulted and was advised to continue anticoagulation and Atorvastatin was started for strict LDL goal of less than 70. Echocardiogram on 2/6/17 showed LVEF 60-65%  mild to moderate concentric LVH  no embolic source for a stroke. Patient was able to ambulate with therapy and was wanting to be discharged home. An appointment was made on 2/13/17 with IR for her myelogram with CT. She is advised to hold off adding Aspirin and Eliquis until this study then resume the next day after procedure complete She will follow up with Neurosurgery as an outpatient., CLINICALS REVIEWED IN POWER CHART DO NOT SUPPORT INPATIENT ADMISSION STATUS.  WILL FLIP AND SEND PM CHANGE FORM | 02032017, 02042017, 02052017, 02062017 | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 4, 4, 4, 4 |
