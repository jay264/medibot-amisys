Increase IV furosemide, 02/12/17 CARDIOLOGY NOTE - Symptomatically she is breathing better.  Hypokalemia increase potassium dose., 02/13/17 PULMONARY NOTE - She's SOB walking to the restroom. She has chronic cough which is at her baseline. It is intermittently productive of white or yellow sputum. No recent change in this. She's had >1 hospitalization for her breathing in the last year. She denies use of steroids/antibiotics for excacerbations of her lung disease b/c she knows there bad for you so I dont take them. she's never had PFTs, Labs  imaging  medical testing including pulse oximetry (above) were reveiwed., BUN: 30 mg/dL High (02/13/17 07:10:11), Carbon Dioxide Level: 26 mMol/L (02/13/17 07:10:11), Creatinine: 1.41 mg/dL High (02/13/17 07:10:11), Glucose Level: 117 mg/dL High (02/13/17 07:10:11), Chloride Level: 105 mMol/L (02/13/17 07:10:11), Potassium Level: 3.5 mMol/L Low (02/13/17 07:10:11), Sodium Level: 142 mMol/L (02/13/17 07:10:11), I personally reviewed her CXR from 2/10 which shows heart failure, , Assessment/Plan:  , , 1.
