however  should she have worsening shortness of breath.  I would discontinue this until we can absolutely rule out systolic heart failure as calcium channel blocker in that setting would be a class III indication., 02/18/17 PULMONARY NOTE, ASSESSMENT:, The patient is a 79-year-old lady with a past medical history described above  who presented from an outside hospital with what seems to be some decompensated heart failure.  There is also a concern for pneumonia.  A CT done at the outside hospital describes a 1.1 cm left upper lobe nodule  for which we were consulted., 1.  Left upper lobe nodule with cavitation., 2.  Acute hypoxic respiratory failure., 3.  Decompensated heart failure  unknown systolic or diastolic., 4.  Possible bacterial pneumonia  possible negative and positive organisms., The patient is on supplemental oxygen  which can be titrated to keep her saturations greater than 89%.  She has responded nicely to Lasix  which continues per the Cardiology team.  An echocardiogram is planned for Monday to better evaluate her heart failure.  Troponins are negative.  A medical management continues from a cardiac perspective., , I am not sure if the patient has pneumonia or not.  There might be some suggestion on chest x-ray  but this could represent some atelectasis and heart failure as well.  I do not know she had a white count  I think a CBC was done at an outside hospital.  I am also not sure if the flu swabs were sent.  We will check a CBC in the morning and if flu swabs were done not at the outside hospital  this should be sent.  Strep pneumo antigen is negative and Legionella is pending.  Blood cultures negative thus far.  Continue Rocephin and Zithromax is reasonable for now.  Could likely switch to PO agent tomorrow for 5-7 day course., 02/19/17 Exacerbation of HF unable to determine if systolic or diastolic at this time, Plan:, - continue ceftriaxone azithromycin  IS  wean 02 as tolerated to maintain sats above 90%, - IV lasix daily  will add extra dose, - seen by pulmonary  as nodule chronic without much enlargement present for 10 years so at most might need repeat chest CT, - ECHO monday, - increased painmeds for chronic back pain worsening with cough, 02/20/17 Pt reports she fell this AM d/t weakness.  She reports continued weakness  LH  and shortness of breath.  She diuresed 475 cc yesterday and her renal function remains stable.
