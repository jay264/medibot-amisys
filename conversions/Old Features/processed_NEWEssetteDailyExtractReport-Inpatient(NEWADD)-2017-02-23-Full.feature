Tube feeds are going to resume.  I'll add chlorhexidine for prophylaxis as he is at risk to even aspirate oral secretions.  He is on his home amlodipine and DVT prophylaxis as well.  Certainly his disease appears progressive and I assume this is irreversible., 02/19/17 Brother is refusing palliative/hospice care, 02/20/17 Brother is now agreeing to Palliative consult, 02/21/17 RRT Note  Asked to see patient with afib/RVR with a SBP of 85.  Upon arrival to the room  patient is awake  on bipap  color pale  skin w/d to touch.  Patient is not on tele  so bedside moniter on showing afib/RVR with rate 130-200.   0100  EKG done.  .9NS fluid bolus started.  BP improved to 93/58.  0015  Dr. Kavel here to see the patient.  Amio bolus and gtt to be given.  Tele on.  BP 95/58., MEETS INPATIENT AS PT CONTINUES TO UNRAVEL AND IS SLOW TO PROGRESS, Notified per mt carmel vista discharge report dated 02.23.17 that pt EXPIRED on 02.22.17 at 1748 | 02172017, 02182017, 02192017, 02202017, 02212017, 02222017 | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 |
