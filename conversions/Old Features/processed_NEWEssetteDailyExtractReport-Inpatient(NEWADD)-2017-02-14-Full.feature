The patient states he has not had a good bowel movement for about one week. He states that he is also had some difficulty urinating over the past day.  He denies any specific abdominal pain  nausea or vomiting  fevers or chills  dysuria  urinary or fecal urgency or hematuria. The patient's right leg is foul-smelling and seeping  he states he has a daily nurse who changes his dressing but states in between changes he has to wrap it in a paper towel because it gets soaked so much. He states he used to see a wound Dr. every 2 months or so but has not seen one for a while at the VA. He saw some physician last week  he thinks because he had some redness to his right wrist and was prescribed a Z-Pak which she has finished.
