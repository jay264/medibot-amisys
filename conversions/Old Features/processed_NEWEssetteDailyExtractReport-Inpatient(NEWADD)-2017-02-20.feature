Found to be in A-flutter. Placed on heparin gtt. Cardiology was consulted. Started on diuresis. Chest x-ray showed large pleural effusion for which he had a thoracentesis on 2/6.  Echo showed EF of 65-70% with probable diastolic heart failure. On 2/7 the patient developed confusion and respiratiory distress. ABG showed hypercapnia and hypoxia. Started on BiPAP and pulmonary disease consulted.
