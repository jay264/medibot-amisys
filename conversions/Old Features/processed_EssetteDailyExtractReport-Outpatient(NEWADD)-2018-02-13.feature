Spoke with Myra  she relays that the EpiFix company submits the request  the doctor sends them the clinical information.  She will call EpiFix and ask them to call me., Advised that Medicare has specific guidelines that have to be meet in order to approve this product and I do not see all the information in the clinicals that were submitted  specifically:, Chronic Wounds are defined as wounds that do not respond to standard wound treatment for at least a 30 day period during organized comprehensive conservative therapy., , For all wounds  documentation (as outlined in the documentation requirements of the policy) and a comprehensive treatment plan  before initiation of a specialized wound therapy product is required., Also-Have adequate circulation/oxygenation to support tissue growth/wound healing as evidenced by physical examination (e.g.  Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) of no less than 0.60  toe pressure > 30mm Hg); and Wound healing is impaired by the systemic use of tobacco. Therefore  ideally patients who have smoked will have ceased smoking or have refrained from systemic tobacco intake for at least 4 weeks during conservative wound care and prior to planned bioengineered skin replacement therapy., LVMM for Lamoy Coburn at MiMedx: 678-695-5066., Asked for specific information:, failed treatment  smoking hx?  time frame of services and applications., PON: extended auth request to 02/28/2018  MediGold has reached out several times for additional clinical information to support this request but has not rec'd anything., Additional clinical rec'd unfortunately it contains a lot of OV notes with very little related to the wound., PC to Cara at requesting provider office: Dr. Kimberly Lewis  937-426-9500., Attached notes are from hospital  PCP  Podiatrist and wound clinic., None address smoking history or treatment over 4 weeks that has failed other than antibiotics., I advised that Epifix can only be applied x 10 for one body site per LCD., Cara okay with changing the request to 10 applications., Wound Application of Cellular and/or Tissue Based Products, (CTPs)  Lower Extremities (L36690), She will ask Dr. Lewis to call me on Monday., No application has been applied yet.  They are anticipating application in the podiatry office., LVMM for member at (937) 479-3073 requested call back related to request rec'd from Podiatrist.  Information from member is needed:, , 1. When did wound on foot occur?, 2. When did mbr seek medical attention for wound?, 3. What has been the treatment so far for the wound?, 4. Does member smoke?,    If so  has she quit smoking and how long ago?, PC from Dr. Lewis  she relays that member waited till wound was pretty bad before seeking treatment  she has been on ATB but not sure that she has failed at another wound treatment.  Dr. Lewis had referred member to the wound clinic but doubts that she went because she is very concerned about co-pays. She also referred her to infectious disease.  , At this point the wound needs this type of wound application and she feels that she can get it under control fairly quickly., She also adds that member does not smoke., We discussed length of wound treatment and number of treatments., She was happy with 10 applications over 12 wks., Asked if it would be better to start auth at 02/19/18 to give her time to get the member scheduled and she said yes. |  |  |  |  | 0 |
