There was no trauma  no seizure activity ahead of time. Patient's husband states that he communicates with his wife with a dry erase board due to her hearing loss  and he noticed while he was sitting across her that all of a sudden she started to the left side of her face looked weak he tried to sit her up in a chair  and she refused to stay seated upright. He tried to communicate with her using a dry erase board and she grabbed a board and turned sideways trying to read it which is unusual for her. He called the ambulance. EMS said her blood pressure was elevated to 170 systolic  she was combative and will not permit an IV placement. Glucose was 191. Patient has been talking and moving all extremities during their transportation. Husband denies any recent trauma  recent surgery  blood thinner use or recent illness., Case discussed with neurology.  The patient while she has an elevated NIH score these are all from chronic deficits related to her hearing loss or dementia. I have no overt signs of facial droop or weakness  patient appears to be back to her mental status and functional baseline according to the husband. I feel the patient may have presented with a TIA. I do not feel that the patient is appropriate tPA candidate as her deficit seemed to have resolved. Neurological consult and is in agreement with this  and radiologic results that were available at the time were discussed with the consultant., 02/10/17 discharge summary note, Mrs. Shanks presented to MCMC when she was felt to have suffered a TIA.  She had no siginficant deficits during her stay.  She was started on a statin for hypercholesterolimia and followed by Neurology.  The patient was started on B12 for deficiency.  She would refuse meds on multiple occasions.  She was ultimately discharged to a SNF with community palliative evaluation., CLINICALS REVIEWED IN POWER CHART DO NOT SUPPORT INPATIENT ADMISSION STAUS.  WILL FLIP AND SEND PM CHANGE FORM | 02072017, 02082017, 02092017, 02102017 | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 4, 4, 4, 4 |
