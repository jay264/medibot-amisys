She was recently admitted with falls and found to have an acute L3 compression fracture in 1/2017. CT head noted a probable subacute/chronic infarct versus watershed infarct. MRI could not be obtained due to pacemaker.  After her January admission she was discharged to home with homecare and missed her Neurosurgery followup with Dr. Mallik. Imaging also showed a large right temporal lobe extraaxial hyperdense mass  most likely a meningioma. Dr. Mallik was consulted and ordered a CT head with contrast which showed a small right parietal infarct  moderate white matter disease  large meningioma overlying the right temporal lobe  unchanged. Per Dr. Mallik  the patient will need an elective myelogram and post myelogram CT of cervical and lumbar region once she is off Aspirin and Eliquis for 5-7 days. This will show if she is amenable to kyphoplasty and if she is having cervical radiculopathy. CTA of head/neck showed right cavernous carotid calcifications causing resultant reduced flow through the right MCA branches. Neurology was consulted and was advised to continue anticoagulation and Atorvastatin was started for strict LDL goal of less than 70. Echocardiogram on 2/6/17 showed LVEF 60-65%  mild to moderate concentric LVH  no embolic source for a stroke. Patient was able to ambulate with therapy and was wanting to be discharged home. An appointment was made on 2/13/17 with IR for her myelogram with CT. She is advised to hold off adding Aspirin and Eliquis until this study then resume the next day after procedure complete She will follow up with Neurosurgery as an outpatient., CLINICALS REVIEWED IN POWER CHART DO NOT SUPPORT INPATIENT ADMISSION STATUS.  WILL FLIP AND SEND PM CHANGE FORM | 02032017, 02042017, 02052017, 02062017 | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 4, 4, 4, 4 |
