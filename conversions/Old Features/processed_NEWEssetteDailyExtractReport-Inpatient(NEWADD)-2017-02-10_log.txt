I found her to be very dyspneic. They instituted treatment with IV magnesium sulfate and bronchodilators per protocol. Transported emergently to the emergency department. On arrival the patient is very sleepy  nonverbal. She has a BiPAP mask in place with BiPAP being initiated by respiratory therapy.history of present illness limited due to patient condition. She is not participating in medical interview., Patient's daughter arrives after initial assessment. She indicates the patient has not been feeling well for the past day or 2.

Patient is a past history of stroke with residual left-sided deficit., Patient has history of COPD but is not using bronchodilators. Chest x-ray obtained and negative for pneumonia  pneumothorax or CHF. I think the patient has acute exacerbation of COPD. Patient is been treated with bronchodilators and BiPAP. She is received IV steroids. Lab work is pending to evaluate for anemia  evidence of non-ST elevation MI  renal impairment. She will require admission.

Chemistries with sodium low at 114 potassium low at 3.0. I have ordered urine osmole's  sodium and creatinine. I suspect her hyponatremia is delusional because daughter states she drinks a lot of diet cola.
