The patient states this morning around 0400 he started having chest pain that radiated up into his mouth. He states everything from his chest to his mouth was aching. He reports he had some mild right arm pain at that time. He states over the weekend he had nausea  dizziness  increased SOB with exertion  and increased fatigued. He reports his chest pain is pretty much gone but his mouth feels dry. He states his current symptoms feel similar to when he needed a stent placed. His most recent stent was placed in 2014. He reports he is not sure if he had indigestion this morning but took a Tums and aspirin with relief. He states he has a chronic productive cough., ASSESSMENT:, The patient had a non-ST elevation infarct.  My guess is that the culprit is a small marginal branch.  I cannot exclude that some more rather a large epicardial blood vessel.  I have recommended cardiac catheterization and possible intervention.  He understands about the increased risk of renal failure because of his underlying renal insufficiency.  I have stopped Valsartan.  I have started him on fluids as of 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.  I have added Brilinta., 82-year-old Caucasian male  presented as transfer from Diley ridge medical center with chest pain.  Patient has significant history of CAD and stent placement in past.  Noted to have elevated Troponin  admitted with diagnosis of NSTEMI.  Started on heparin drip and other cardiac meds  cardiology consulted.  Noted to have creatinine of 2.5 with known CKD.  Renal consulted as high risk for CIN.  After discussing risk and benefits  cardiac cath performed on 2/15/17  showed no major occlusion  possible small embolism or plaque rupture.  Cardiology did not recommend any change in meds and cleared for discharge next day.  Creatinine stable on discharge., MEETS ACO CORONARY Y, MEETS ACO CORONARY  Y     11288.00 | 02132017, 02142017, 02152017, 02162017 | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 4, 4, 4, 4 |
