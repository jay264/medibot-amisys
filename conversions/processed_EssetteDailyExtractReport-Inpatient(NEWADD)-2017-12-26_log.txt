Â The syncopal episode sounds like vasovagal syncope by history. Â His pacemaker was interrogated and did not show any tachyarrhythmias that would explain his syncope. Â I do think he needs a stress test, but I think it is reasonable to do this as an outpatient. Â I will communicate this with Dr. Patel's office. Â The patient would rather like to go home for Christmas. Â I have instructed him on staying well hydrated and avoiding situations that typically lead to syncope including alcohol consumption and dehydration.
