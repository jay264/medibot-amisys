I had a lengthy discussion with 2 daughters (daughter who is a veterinarian by phone) yesterday. I don't think she is a good candidate for invasive evaluation given her advanced dementia. My recommendations are for dual platelet therapy  beta blockers  high-dose atorvastatin  and ACE inhibitor. IF she were to have further chest pain or worsening heart failure could consider catheterization to see if something can be intervened upon but she would never be a surgical candidate. The other option would be for biventricular pacemaker-> she would never be an ICD candidate given the severity of her dementia. Will get up and ambulate today.  , Acute pulmonary edema: She has severe left ventricular dysfunction related to her left bundle branch block as well as underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. Again I think medical therapy is all that is warranted. She remains on ACE inhibitor  Aldactone  Lasix  beta blocker. Have increased Lasix to BID, Plan: Increase Furosemide,          Dual platelet therapy  high-dose atorvastatin  ACE inhibitor and beta blocker,          Aldactone plus the Lasix,          Ambulate in the halls,          Invasive evaluation/biventricular pacing only if symptoms prove refractory, MEETS INPATIENT  SLOW TO PROGRESS | 02182017| Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 6 |
