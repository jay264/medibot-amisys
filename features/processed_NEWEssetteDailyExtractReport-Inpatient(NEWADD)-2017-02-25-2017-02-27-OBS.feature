As per discussion with son  the patient has been having recent decline in her mental status too.  She started having issues with her short term memory.  The patient's initial EKG was unremarkable except for frequent PVCs.  The patient started on tele to observe for any signs of cardiac arrhythmia that could have cause the syncope. The patient as well as her son denies any signs of seizure-like activity.  I suspect that her current episode of fall is precipitated by pain meds and benzos. As per discussion with her son  son is also concerned about taking too many pain medications. However also concerned about possible seizure disorder., CT of the head was unremarkable.   Would recommend to avoid sedative medications and the patient would benefit from home health care given her frequent falls., CLINICALS REVIEWED IN POWER CHART DO NOT SUPPORT INPATIENT ADMISSION STATUS.  WILL SEND PM CHANGE FORM TO CHANGE TO OBSERVATION | 02222017 | Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved,  | 3 |
