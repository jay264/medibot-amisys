She has only recently been intubated shortly after I saw her.  Nursing staff are actively titrating up her sedation., CRITICAL CARE NOTE, 64-year-old lady with a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident  obesity  hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea.  She presented from home where she was found to be very weak and with a decreased level of consciousness.  She had some acute-on-chronic CO2 retention and became hypoxic in the ER.  She had a protracted and difficult endotracheal intubation requiring emergent anesthesia in order to intubate.  I cannot find documentation as to whether or not she was hypoxic during this event.  A CT afterward was concerning for anoxic brain injury.  She remains unresponsive in the ICU., , 1.  Acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure., 2.  Bacterial pneumonia with concerns for gram-negative and gram-positive organisms  possible aspiration., 3.  Encephalopathy with possible anoxic brain injury., 4.  Hypertension  poorly controlled., 5.  History of cerebrovascular accidents. maintained on Plavix normally., 6.  History of tracheo-bronchomalacia., , PLAN:, From a respiratory standpoint  I think we overcorrected her CO2 and she is alkalotic.  Last blood gas was at 5:00 a.m. and I am repeating that now.  I will adjust the ventilator accordingly.  She has been placed on vancomycin and Zosyn.  It has been several months since her last hospital admission.  I am going to discontinue the vancomycin.  It is reasonable to continue the Zosyn  given concern for potential aspiration.  We will await results of microbiologic data and adjust accordingly.  Bronchodilators are ordered., , Neurologically  the findings are very concerning.  She is not responsive.  When the propofol was turned completely off  she clenched and demonstrated what might have been some seizure-like activity.  At this point  we are going to titrate the propofol to find the lowest possible dose that prevents these episodes.  We will continue to assess her neurologically.  Neurology Consulted., MEETS INPATIENT CRITICAL CARE ADMIT | 02132017, 02142017, 02152017, 02162017, 02172017, 02182017, 02192017, 02202017, 02212017, 02222017, 02232017, 02242017, 02252017, 02262017, 02272017, 02282017, 03012017, 03022017, 03032017, 03042017, 03052017, 03062017, 03072017, 03082017, 03092017, 03102017 | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient, Inpatient | Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26 |
