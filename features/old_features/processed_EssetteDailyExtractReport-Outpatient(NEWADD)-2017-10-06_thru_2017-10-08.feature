These 24-hour measurements are stored in the device and are later interpreted by the physician., , Indications and Limitations of Coverage, , ABPM must be performed for at least 24 hours to meet coverage criteria., , ABPM is only covered for those patients with suspected white coat hypertension. Suspected white coat hypertension is defined as, ,    Office blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg on at least three separate clinic/office visits with two separate measurements made at each visit;,    At least two documented blood pressure measurements taken outside the office which are <140/90 mm Hg; and,    No evidence of end-organ damage., , The information obtained by ABPM is necessary in order to determine the appropriate management of the patient. ABPM is not covered for any other uses. In the rare circumstance that ABPM needs to be performed more than once in a patient  the qualifying criteria described above must be met for each subsequent ABPM test., , For those patients that undergo ABPM and have an ambulatory blood pressure of <135/85 with no evidence of end-organ damage  it is likely that their cardiovascular risk is similar to that of normotensives. They should be followed over time. Patients for which ABPM demonstrates a blood pressure of >135/85 may be at increased cardiovascular risk  and a physician may wish to consider antihypertensive therapy., Letter is written in appropriate language with no abbreviations and is therefore approved. |  |  |  |  | 0 |
