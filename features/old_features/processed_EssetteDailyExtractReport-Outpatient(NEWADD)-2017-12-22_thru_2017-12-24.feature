Equipment which the beneficiary owns or is a capped rental item may be replaced in cases of loss or irreparable damage. Irreparable damage refers to a specific accident or to a natural disaster (e.g.  fire  flood  etc.)., Irreparable wear refers to deterioration sustained from day-to-day usage over time and a specific event cannot be identified. Replacement of equipment due to irreparable wear takes into consideration the reasonable  useful lifetime of the equipment. If the equipment has been in continuous use by the beneficiary on either a rental or purchase basis for the equipment’s useful lifetime  then the beneficiary may elect to obtain a new piece of equipment., The reasonable  useful lifetime of durable medical equipment is determined through program instructions. In the absence of program instructions  DME MACs determine the reasonable  useful lifetime of equipment  but in no case can it be less than five years., Consulted director  Rhonda Maddern  for clarification on how to proceed, From director: The language is clear regarding irreparable damage and includes the example FIRE.  So good to go on authorizing those requests.  For the items that are non- covered and or member responsibility  then home owners insurance would be applicable., PC to Cornerstone for CPT codes.  Spoke with Angela who looks back to last delivery dates of items requested and relays that member is eligible for a CPAP  last was given in 2007.  She is also eligible for a Nebulizer.  The only thing not reimbursable would be the So Clean Machine as it is a purchase convenience item only., Per Anglea at Cornerstone  there is no CPT/HCPC code for the So Clean Machine since its not a billable item., PON: Member has been approved for all items requested except the SoClean machine used to clean the CPAP machine.  The SoClean is not an item the Medicare will approve., The rest of items are approved for replacement thru Cornerstone.  Approval fax has been sent to Cornerstone., Letter is written in appropriate language with no abbreviations and is therefore approved. |  |  |  |  | 0 |
