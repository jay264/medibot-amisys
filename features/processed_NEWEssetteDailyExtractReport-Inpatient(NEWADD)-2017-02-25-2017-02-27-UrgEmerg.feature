Patient notably was discharged in the hospital about one week ago and. The patient describes that over the course the past week his pain has been getting gradually worse despite his outpatient pain medication. Patient has been on radiation treatment as well. Over the course the weekend the patient did start to develop severe diarrhea which has been present for the last few days. He has been taking some Imodium which the most part had not helped although today the diarrhea is somewhat improved.  Laboratory studies were obtained to triage which were remarkable for a leukopenia with white count of 3.1 as well as a hyponatremia that is new with a sodium of 125. The patient was started on IV hydration. Dilaudid was ordered for pain control.  , 02/15/17 CHANGED TO INPATIENT BY ATTENDING., 02/16/17 CRS Note - I discussed NGT decompression for another 24 hrs with patient and wife.
