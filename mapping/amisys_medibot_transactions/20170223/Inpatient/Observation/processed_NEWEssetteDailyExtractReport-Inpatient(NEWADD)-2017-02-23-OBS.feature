There  a CAT scan of the head was done  which showed a large mass with mass effect and right-to-left shift  so he was transferred to us for further management., Intracranial mass  primary malignancy versus metastasis from previously existing prostate cancer.  Neurosurgery is planning for an MRI tomorrow.  He seems neurologically stable. CT C/A/P ordered for tomorrow for mets w/u. No emergent surgical intervention warranted., 2.21 MRI scan of his brain was performed this morning and this looks like a high-grade glioma on the right hand side at the temporoparietal area.
