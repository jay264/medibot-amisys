Increase IV furosemide, 02/12/17 CARDIOLOGY NOTE - Symptomatically she is breathing better.  Hypokalemia increase potassium dose., 02/13/17 PULMONARY NOTE - She's SOB walking to the restroom. She has chronic cough which is at her baseline. It is intermittently productive of white or yellow sputum. No recent change in this. She's had >1 hospitalization for her breathing in the last year.
