She was monitored on telemetry without acute events., Bloody diarrhea - resolved spontaneously. GI was consulted. They reviewed recent endoscopy reports and recommended stool studies. They suggetsed her symptoms were likely due to a viral gastroenteritis. She clinically improved and was stable for discharge., Anemia  likely secondary to acute blood loss from diarrhea- Her hemoglobin was monitored and dropped to a nadir of 7.6 but had improved to 8.6 at time of discharge. She did not require any blood transfusions., Acute kidney injury - in the setting of diarrhea. Improved with IV hydration and temporary suspension of lasix and lisinopril. She returned back to her baseline at time of discharge so will be resumed on home meds., Rhabdomyolysis  possible - She was found to have elevated creatine kinase in the setting of being passed out  and contributing to her AKI. Her statin was temporarily held and she will be discharged on a lower dose of atorvastatin 20mg instead of 40mg daily. This can be monitored outpatient.
