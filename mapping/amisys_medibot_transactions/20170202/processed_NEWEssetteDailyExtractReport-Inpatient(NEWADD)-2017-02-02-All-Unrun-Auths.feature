CT abdomen showed dilatation of the pancreatic duct  therefore MRCP ordered.Surgery consulted for assistance. MRCP showed pancreatic duct dilation (7mm in head  8mm in body of pancreas) and cystic dilation of pancreatic side branches. Dilatation is most likely related to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. No pancreatic mass. Surgery was following and no plans for surgical intervention as probable IPMN is clinically irrelevant at advanced age. CT chest was also performed showingsome underaeration of right lobe but no other abnormalities. the patient feels a bit better  he is aware that we were not able to find an etiology of his pain  I advised him to use some heating pads and try pain medications for the next days. He understands and agreed with discharge. | 01282017, 01292017, 01302017, 01312017, 02012017 | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation, Observation | Approved, Approved, Approved, Approved,  | 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 |
